A basic beat plays throughout the game. The user is instructed to either slap (swipe the screen), double slap (swipe the screen twice with an offbeat), triple slap (swipe the screen three times with the third being a swipe up), or head bash (swipe downward). The slap victim's name is Bob. The game registers every swipe as a left, right, up, or down swipe. Bob reacts differently to each slap and the user gets points for using the right slap on beat. There is a high score system and a combo system as well as a health bar. If the player misses too many slaps, Bob gets bored, dies and the game ends.\r\n\r\n### Technologies\r\nObjective-C, XCode, SpriteBuilder, Cocos2D, Swift\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nBrian Wang \r\n - Email: brianwang9100@gmail.com\r\n - LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/brianwang9100\r\n - GitHub: www.github.com/brianwang9100\r\n\r\nJoe Wang \r\n - Email: joewang704@gatech.edu\r\n - LinkedIn:\r\n - GitHub: www.github.com/joewang704","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
