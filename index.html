<p>HackGT Project (September 2014)</p>

<p>8-Bit styled game where you slap a character to the beat using swipes. A basic beat plays throughout the game. The user is instructed to either slap (swipe the screen), double slap (swipe the screen twice with an offbeat), triple slap (swipe the screen three times with the third being a swipe up), or head bash (swipe downward). The slap victim's name is Bob. The game registers every swipe as a left, right, up, or down swipe. Bob reacts differently to each slap and the user gets points for using the right slap on beat. There is a high score system and a combo system as well as a health bar. If the player misses too many slaps, Bob gets bored, dies and the game ends.</p>

<a name="our-thoughts" class="anchor" href="#our-thoughts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Thoughts</h3>

<p>We were inspired by the game Rhythm Heaven for the Wii, in which players are instructed to strike the WiiMote in specific rhythms based on the song playing. We originally planned to code the iOS app in Swift and integrate the application with the Myo hardware. Then we ran into some problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Swift was unstable and made our code crash every single time and the apple support team at the time couldn't fix it, so thus Brian rewrote the entire code in Objective-C.</li>
<li>We learned that the Myo hardware was unavailable halfway through development and decided to simply make a plain iOS game as we were already far into development. </li>
</ol>

<p>We still had a lot of fun creating demoing this game for everyone. They were especially impressed with the design and animations. The game is due for a huge update before its release on the AppStore.</p>
